# Indian-for-DeepLearning

This is the keras implementation for the INDIAN algorithm based on the paper *An Inertial Newton Algorithm for Deep Learning* ([arXiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12278)) by C. Castera, J. Bolte, C. Fevotte and E. Pauwels.

It is currently only avaiable for Keras along with a tutorial on how to use it to train your own keras model and a tutorial.

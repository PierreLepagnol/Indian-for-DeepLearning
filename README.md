# Indian-for-DeepLearning

This is the keras implementation for the INDIAN algorithm based on the paper *An Inertial Newton Algorithm for Deep Learning* ([arXiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12278)) by C. Castera, J. Bolte, C. Fevotte and E. Pauwels.

It is currently avaiable both for Keras and Tensorflow along with a tutorials on how to use it to train your own keras model. In addition, there is a full toy example on popular datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10), with a not too big neural network.

* [Tensorflow Version](https://github.com/camcastera/Indian-for-DeepLearning/tree/master/indian_for_tensorflow)

_NB_: To begin with Deep Learning we recommand to use Keras.
